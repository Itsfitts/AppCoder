# üì± AppCoder: Turn Your App Ideas into Reality ‚Äì Right On Your Phone!

**AppCoder** is a mobile Android app that empowers you to build your own apps directly on your phone ‚Äî no programming experience required! You only need to describe your app and it will be build automatically.

## üöÄ Get Started with the First Release!

**The First AppCoder Version is ready for you to test!**

1.  **‚¨áÔ∏è Download the APK:**
    *   Go to the **[latest release page](https://github.com/ChristophGeske/AppCoder/releases)**
    *   Download `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` or another .apk according to your device type.

2.  **üîë Get Your Free Gemini API Key:**
    *   AppCoder needs a Gemini API key to generate code automatically.
    *   Visit Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    *   Sign in and click "Create API key". Copy this key ideally to your phones clipboard.

3.  **üì≤ Install & Use AppCoder:**
    *   See the **[latest release page](https://github.com/ChristophGeske/AppCoder/releases)** for instructions.

## üí° What is AppCoder?

AppCoder transforms your plain English descriptions into working app code using advanced LLMs like **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview**. 

Simply describe your app vision, and AppCoder handles the code generation.

**Who is AppCoder for?**
*   **Non-programmers:** Create apps without technical barriers.
*   **Experienced Developers:** Rapidly prototype ideas.

Export the generated code to continue development on a desktop with professional tools.

**What is AppCoder able to do?**
*   Currently the limiting factor determining how complex the app can get is the LLM running in the background.
*   The default LLM in this app is Gemini 2.5 Flash with Thinking maximised. This flash model is free and able to do very simple apps like a ToDo list app or a tic-tac-toe game.
*   Using Gemini 2.5 Pro should make significantly more complex apps possible but is not free.
*   A free and fast way to make more complex apps possible is by using Claude Sonnet 4 with Artefacts enabled. In the Antropic app you can quickly iterate over your app idea using the Artifacts view and programming in HTML until all your app elements stand. If Claude is done making the HTML version of your app prompt it to translate the HTML code into Android code. Then copy and past the code into the prompt field of AppCoder. Gemini 2.5 Flash running inside AppCoder seems capable enough to create a working android app from this code. By using Claude Sonnet 4 with artefacts you can itterate quickly much faster then weiting and installing the aandroid app first. Also the Sonnet 4 model creates much better code compared to Gemini 2.5 Flash. This way more complex apps like a Tetris game become possible for free.
*   If the app is to complex however the LLM can fail and introduces to many errors so that the build might fails or the installation fails or the installed app crashes on start or the app contains major bugs.
*   After the first build which takes much longer follow up builds take around 60 seconds on a modern phone from posting your app description to having the finished app installed on your phone.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Known Issues (MVP v1.0.0) [Bug fixes are planned üõ†Ô∏è] 

*   **Simple App Ideas Work Best:** For this first version, if the LLM generates non-working code (e.g., from a complex description), you must build a new app with a **new app name** (overwriting isn't implemented yet). Try simplifying your initial idea if it fails.
*   **AppCoder's Initial Setup:**
    *   The first run of AppCoder installs necessary components. This can occasionally fail. **Reinstalling the AppCoder `.apk` usually fixes this.**
    *   When you close the app during the initial setup, you might get stuck on the initial start screen. If stuck during initial setup, reinstall AppCoder to start the setup process again. 
*   **Modify Function:** Modifying existing apps is not working currently. All apps are one shot they either work on first generation or not.

## üõ†Ô∏è For more serious Developers: Building AppCoder from Source

This section is for those who want to compile AppCoder from its source code. **If you just downloaded the APK, you can skip this.**

This might be interested for you if you want to implement your own LLM API calls or if you want to implement advanced LLM Agent features to improve the code generation like automated testing and such features.

1.  **Clone this repository.**
2.  **Connect your Android smartphone** to your computer.
3.  **Build and install the AppCoder APK** onto your phone using **Android Studio Meerkat 2024.3.2**. [No change to IDE name]
4.  **Development Setup Notes:**
    *   **Line Endings:** Use **LF** (not CRLF). (This issue should be fixed with the last commit via `.gitattributes`)
    *   **Gradle JDK:** JDK 21.
5.  **Troubleshooting Builds from Source:**
    *   **Gradle build fails in Android Studio:** Try running the build process again.
    *   **Build of the *generated app* (by AppCoder) on the phone fails (during its terminal run):** Uninstall the partially built app and restart the build process within AppCoder.
6. You find the LLM related Code under AppCoder\core\app\src\main\java\com\itsaky\androidide\dialogs the rest of the app is basically the original AndroidIDE code only modefied in a few areas for example getting it streamlined to better work for LLM based development.
