# üì± AppCoder: Turn Your App Ideas into Reality ‚Äì Right On Your Phone!

**AppCoder** is a mobile Android app that empowers you to build your own apps directly on your phone ‚Äî no programming experience required! You only need to describe your app and it will be build automatically.

## üöÄ Get Started with the MVP Release!

**The AppCoder MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is ready for you to test!**

1.  **‚¨áÔ∏è Download the APK:**
    *   Go to the latest release: **[https://github.com/ChristophGeske/AppCoder/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/ChristophGeske/AppCoder/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**
    *   Download `app-release.apk` (or `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` if you prefer and know it's for your device).

2.  **üîë Get Your Free Gemini API Key:**
    *   AppCoder needs a Gemini API key to generate code.
    *   Visit Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    *   Sign in and click "Create API key". Copy this key.

3.  **üì≤ Install & Use AppCoder:**
    *   Transfer the downloaded `.apk` file to your Android phone.
    *   On your phone, open a file manager, find the `.apk`, and tap to install.
        *   üëâ You might need to **enable "Install from unknown sources"** in your phone's settings.
    *   After AppCoder installs and completes its initial setup (grant permissions, wait for components):
        *   Tap the **üîµ blue plus (+) button**.
        *   Enter an **App Name**, a **simple App Description** (keep ideas straightforward for this MVP!), and paste your **Gemini API Key**.
        *   Tap "Continue."
    *   After code generation by the LLM (this can take a moment, especially on the first app build), you'll be prompted to **build** your new app.
    *   When installing your *generated app*, you might need to **expand the installation prompt to find and select "Install anyway"**.

## üí° What is AppCoder?

AppCoder transforms your plain English descriptions into working app code using advanced LLMs like **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview**. [No change, keeping your specified model]

Simply describe your app vision, and AppCoder handles the code generation.

**Who is AppCoder for?**
*   **Non-programmers:** Create apps without technical barriers.
*   **Experienced Developers:** Rapidly prototype ideas.

Export the generated code to continue development on a desktop with professional tools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Known Issues (MVP v1.0.0)

*   **Simple App Ideas Work Best:** For this MVP, if the LLM generates non-working code (e.g., from a complex description), you must build a new app with a **new app name** (overwriting isn't implemented). Try simplifying your initial idea if it fails.
*   **AppCoder's Initial Setup:**
    *   The first run of AppCoder installs necessary components. This can occasionally fail. **Reinstalling the AppCoder `.apk` usually fixes this.**
    *   During this initial setup, **use only on-screen buttons** (not system back/home buttons) to avoid getting stuck. If stuck, reinstall AppCoder. [Bug fix is planned üõ†Ô∏è]
*   **Gemini API Key Required:** You must enter your key for AppCoder to function.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers: Building AppCoder from Source

This section is for those who want to compile AppCoder from its source code. **If you just downloaded the APK, you can skip this.**

1.  **Clone this repository.**
2.  **Connect your Android smartphone** to your computer.
3.  **Build and install the AppCoder APK** onto your phone using **Android Studio Meerkat 2024.3.2**. [No change to IDE name]
4.  **Development Setup Notes:**
    *   **Line Endings:** Use **LF** (not CRLF). (This issue should be fixed with the last commit via `.gitattributes`)
    *   **Gradle JDK:** JDK 21.
5.  **Troubleshooting Builds from Source:**
    *   **Gradle build fails in Android Studio:** Try running the build process again.
    *   **Build of the *generated app* (by AppCoder) on the phone fails (during its terminal run):** Uninstall the partially built app and restart the build process within AppCoder.
