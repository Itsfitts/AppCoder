## Description

Powered by advanced large language models like **ChatGPT**, AppCoder turns plain English descriptions into real, working code.  
Simply describe what you envision, engage in a bit of back and forth to let ChatGPT iron out any bugs, and your app is ready.

AppCoder is designed for non-programmers, removing all barriers to app creation. It also serves as a great tool for experienced developers who need to rapidly prototype an idea or test concepts.

When you're ready to take your app further, you can export the code and continue development on your desktop environment using more advanced programming tools.
