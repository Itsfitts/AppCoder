# AppCoder

**AppCoder** is a mobile app that lets you build fully functional apps directly on your phone â€” no programming experience required.

## Project Status

> **CURRENTLY THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN A DEVELOPMENT PHASE AND THERE IS NO .APK FILE YET TO DOWNLOAD. STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES.**

## Description

Powered by advanced large language models like **ChatGPT**, AppCoder turns plain English descriptions into real, working code.  
Simply describe what you envision, engage in a bit of back and forth to let ChatGPT iron out any bugs, and your app is ready.

AppCoder is designed for non-programmers, removing all barriers to app creation. It also serves as a great tool for experienced developers who need to rapidly prototype an idea or test concepts.

When you're ready to take your app further, you can export the code and continue development on your desktop environment using more advanced programming tools.

## Setting up the Free API

The current project uses the Gemini API because you get it for free. 
It appears they recently changed the setup process instead of simply generating an API key on the AIStudio website [https://aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and use it by pasting it in the APIKey Input field in the app, you now also have to set up a billing account [by pressing the "Go to billing View usage data](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) in order to activate the free APIKey.

## When Running the Project and it Fails Try the Following 

My settings and software:
1. Most of these editors have a way to change line endings. Look in the bottom status bar or in the File/Edit menus for an option like "Line Separators," "Line Endings," or similar, and change it from "CRLF" to "LF".
2. Use Android Studio Meerkat 2024.3.2
3. Gradle jdk-21

Issues I Experienced when Running the IDE App:
1. Somtimes the gradle build fails in android studio - simply run the graidle build again
2. Sometimes the build on the phone fails during the terminal run - uninstall and run again
3. If you are stuck in the initial screen due to leaving the installation process you also need to uninstall and rerun the app installation
